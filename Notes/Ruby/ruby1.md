## Humble Beginnings

#### Stringy Situations
To make the simplest Ruby program in existence (Print 'Hello World'), we write the following Ruby code:
```Ruby
# hello.rb
puts("Hello World!")
puts "Hello World!"
puts 'Hello World!'
```
Here are 3 different ways of executing the same `puts` method which will print a string to the console. I personally recommend using parenthesis to keep possible bugs out of the code but you are free to include them or not.

To execute the code to see if it will print `Hello World!` simply open up a terminal, go to the directory your ruby file is located and type:
```BASH
ruby hello.rb
```
Where `hello.rb` contains the Ruby code above. The output should be 3 `Hello World!`s in the console
