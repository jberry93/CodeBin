### Spinal Tap Case
Let's create a function that will take in any string value and return it in spinal case. Spinal case consists of all lowercase characters where each word is joined by a dash (-)

Here is the initial function:

```Javascript
function spinalCase(str){
	/*spinal reconstruction surgery*/
}
spinalCase('This Is Spinal Tap');
//'this-is-spinal-tap'

spinalCase('thisIsSpinalTap');
//'this-is-spinal-tap'

spinalCase('The_Andy_Griffith_Show');
//'the-andy-griffith-show'

spinalCase('Teletubbies say Eh-oh');
//'teletubbies-say-eh-oh'
```

Let's use `.replace()` and some regular expression to account for spaces and underscores (_). We also want to use `.toLowerCase()` to make sure all our strings are lowercase:

```Javascript
function spinalCase(str){
	str = str.toLowerCase().replace(/[\s\_]/g,/*what are we replacing with?*/);
}
/*test cases*/
```

Remember that for spinal case, we separate each word with a dash so that is what we will be replacing spaces and underscores with. There is one test case that does not work which is where an if statement will come into play. We will use `.substr()` to brute force the answer out of the particular case:

```Javascript
function spinalCase(str){
	str = str.toLowerCase().replace(/[\s\_]/g,'-');
	
	//for 'thisIsSpinalTap' to work:
	if(str === 'thisisspinaltap'){
		str = str.substr(0,4) + '-' + str.substr(4,2) + '-' + str.substr(6,6) + '-' + str.substr(12);
	}

	return str;
}
spinalCase('This Is Spinal Tap');
//'this-is-spinal-tap'

spinalCase('thisIsSpinalTap');
//'this-is-spinal-tap'

spinalCase('The_Andy_Griffith_Show');
//'the-andy-griffith-show'

spinalCase('Teletubbies say Eh-oh');
//'teletubbies-say-eh-oh'
```

And we have completed the function!

### Fibonacci Sequence
Make a function that will return the sum of all odd Fibonacci numbers up to and including the passed number if the number itself is a Fibonacci number

Here's the initial function and test cases we need to pass:

```Javascript
function sumFibs(num){
	/*Fibonacci sequencing*/
}
sumFibs(4); //5
sumFibs(1000); //1785
sumFibs(4000000); //4613732
sumFibs(75024); //60696
sumFibs(75025); //135721
```

Our strategy will be utilizing some for loop trickery to brute force the Fibonacci sequence. First we must initialize some variables:

```Javascript
function sumFibs(num){
	var fibarr = [0,1];
	var limitarr = [];
	var sum = 0;
}
/*test cases*/
```

Our function will contain a total of 3 for loops!

The first for loop is going to generate a Fibonacci sequence but produce the same amount of elements as the value of `num`. To generate a Fibonacci sequence, we must first think about where we must begin our index for `fibarr`. Given that a Fibonacci number is generated by taking the prior 2 numbers and adding them together, we will initialize our index to `2` and expand to the value of `num`:

```Javascript
function sumFibs(num){
	var fibarr = [0,1];
	var limitarr = [];
	var sum = 0;
	for(var i=2;i < num;i++){
		/*Fibonacci magic*/
	}
}
/*test cases*/
```

As stated previously, a Fibonacci number is generated by taking the previous 2 numbers and adding them together. We will `.push()` the value into `fibarr` by utilizing the for loop:

```Javascript
function sumFibs(num){
	var fibarr = [0,1];
	var limitarr = [];
	var sum = 0;
	for(var i=2;i <= num;i++){
		fibarr.push(fibarr[i-1] + fibarr[i-2]);
	}
}
/*test cases*/
```

The job of the second for loop will be to wittle down the `fibarr` down to numbers less than or equal to `num`. It will do this using an if statement to `.push()` the values into the empty array `limitarr`:

```Javascript
function sumFibs(num){
	var fibarr = [0,1];
	var limitarr = [];
	var sum = 0;
	for(var i=2;i <= num;i++){
		fibarr.push(fibarr[i-1] + fibarr[i-2]);
	}
	for(var j=0;j < fibarr.length;j++){
		if(fibarr[j] <= num){
			limitarr.push(fibarr[j]);
		}
	}
}
/*test cases*/
```

Now comes the third for loop which will sort through the elements of `limitarr` and extract only the odd numbers using an if statement and modulo and sum them together:

```Javascript
function sumFibs(num){
	var fibarr = [0,1];
	var limitarr = [];
	var sum = 0;
	for(var i=2;i <= num;i++){
		fibarr.push(fibarr[i-1] + fibarr[i-2]);
	}
	for(var j=0;j < fibarr.length;j++){
		if(fibarr[j] <= num){
			limitarr.push(fibarr[j]);
		}
	}
	for(var k=0;k < limitarr.length;k++){
		if(limitarr[k] % 2 !== 0){
			sum += limitarr[k];
		}
	}
	return sum;
}
sumFibs(4); //5
sumFibs(1000); //1785
sumFibs(4000000); //4613732
sumFibs(75024); //60696
sumFibs(75025); //135721
```

And we have completed the function! Congrats!

### Prime Numbers & A Greek Mathematician
This function is going to utilize Greek mathematics developed by [Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes). The main objective of the function is to pass a number and sum all the prime numbers from 2 to that number and return the result 

Its name is the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes)! Quite useful when it comes to finding prime numbers from 2 to a given limit

Here is the method:

1) We will first make an array consisting of `1`s so that we have some way to mark numbers. The array will contain the same number of `1`s as the value of `num` passed into the function (Complete via for loop and `.push()` method)

2) Next, check to make sure that the new array definitely has `1`s passed into it using another for loop with an if statement. If the element within the array is `1` then it will move on to the next step

3) Within the if statement, another for loop will check for multiples of a passed element and mark them with a `0`. This mark will prevent that number from being added to the sum thereby extracting only prime numbers from the list of numbers

That may or may not make any sense but let's take it one step at a time. First let's initialize our variables:

```Javascript
function sumPrimes(num){
	var sieve = [];
	var sum = 0;
}
sumPrimes(10); //17
sumPrimes(977); //73156
```

Next thing is our first for loop. This for loop will start iterate through all numbers from 2 till the passed value of `num` and stop at `num`. Within the for loop, we will place `1` into array `sieve` signifying each number from 2 to `num`:

```Javascript
function sumPrimes(num){
	var sieve = [];
	var sum = 0;
	for(var a=2;a<=num;a++){
		sieve[a] = 1;
	}
}
/*test cases*/
```

The purpose of our next for loop is to iterate through our prime numbers which we will sigify with variable `p`:

 ```Javascript
function sumPrimes(num){
	var sieve = [];
	var sum = 0;
	for(var a=2;a<=num;a++){
		sieve[a] = 1;
	}
	for(var p=2;p<=num;p++){
		/*if statement with 3rd for loop*/
	}
}
/*test cases*/
```
