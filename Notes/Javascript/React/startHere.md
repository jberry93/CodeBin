## React JS

### What is this directory?
This directory will consist of markdown files documenting my progress through learning React

### Who are you?
I am a life-long learner who loves to build things whether it be landing pages, full-stack apps, or simple tests, I love it all! I also enjoy teaching but I want to gain some experience in the software development field before labeling myself as an expert in the field. Talk to me in another 10-15 years from now and hopefully I'll be a seasoned code ninja

### Why are you doing this?
Because this is how I learn! Learning through teaching has been effective for me to grasp difficult concepts so I see this as a vector for learning and implementing efficient code.

### What else are you working on?
I currently have been playing with Angular and React so expect some notes or a directory on those two frameworks as well. Hopefully I can ship out two project: one for Angular and one for React.

### I have no more questions
Awesome! You are ready for the next step which is all about setting up React. Good luck :+1:
