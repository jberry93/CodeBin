# Welcome!

With React, you are going to need to know a little bit of JavaScript so that you can...
- Create a local web server using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
- Set up routes to your web server
- Use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to import packages (not JavaScript but need it!!)
- Understand the basics of using objects and functions in JavaScript

Fear not! I will go through the process of setting up a local web server using NodeJS and Express for React. The only instance you need to use this is if you want to use the Chrome browser to view your React app.

**Reason being: Chrome does not allow you to load files using XHR (XMLHttpRequest)**

On the other hand, Safari and Firefox work just fine!

##### Are you ready for some fun?
