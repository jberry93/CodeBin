# Welcome!
The only assumption I am making here is that you can at least write FizzBuzz which should be pretty easy I hope.

##### If you don't know what FizzBuzz is, here you go: [FizzBuzz](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=fizzbuzz)

## Here are 3 ways to declare a variable:
- `var` - "Easy"
- `let` - "Huh? Never used that one"
- `const` - "WTF? This is JavaScript?"

### How does `var` do?
Well if you wrote any code in JavaScript, most likely you used `var` at least once. The main thing we have to worry about when using `var` is its *execution context*.

##### Two words: *execution context*

So what does this mean?
