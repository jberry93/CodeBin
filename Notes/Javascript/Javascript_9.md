### Smallest Common Multiple
This function will take in an array containing 2 numbers which indicates a range. The job of this function is to find the least common multiple that is evenly divisibly by every number in this range

Here's the initial function:

```Javascript
function smallestCommons(arr){
	/*Least Common Multiple*/
}
smallestCommons([1,5]); //60
smallestCommons([5,1]); //60
smallestCommons([1,13]); //360360
```

We will be using more Greek mathematics in this case but before that we need to set up the function so that we can feed the algorithm ('Greek mathematics' part) an array of all the numbers in the range so let's first make that array:
