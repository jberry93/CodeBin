### Mutations
Make a function whose argument is an array with 2 strings. If the first element string in the array has all the letters of the second element string in the same array then return true. If not, return false.

Here's the basic setup of a function...again:

```Javascript
function mutation(arr){
	//make algorithm
}
mutation(['hello','hey']);
```
