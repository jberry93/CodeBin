<!--This is a HTML comment and this will be used to describe the
significance of every step-->

<!--Remember that HTML stands for 'HyperText Markup Language' where 'Hypertext' is the text with links in it. A 'Markup Language' is a programming language used to make text do more than just sit on the page, it can turn text into images, links, tables, lists, etc-->

<!--So what makes a webpage pretty? That's from CSS or 'Cascading Style Sheets'. CSS is the skin and makeup that overlaps the bare bones of HTML-->

<!--To begin, we must first tell the browser to read HTML:-->
<!DOCTYPE html> <!--Now we need to begin the HTML document:-->
<html> <!--The 'html' tags = <> begins and ends the HTML doc-->

<!--First of all here's a way to insert bold font into your doc:-->
	<strong>This text is bold</strong> <!--The "strong" tags will bold text-->

<!--Important note: Tags nest meaning that they need to be closed in the right order:-->
	<first tag><second tag>Some text</second tag></first tag>

<!--For every HTML doc, there is a head and a body so let's add a head and a title for the head:-->
	<head>
		<title>Title of My Webpage</title>
	</head>

<!--Now that we have a title and a heading, let's add the body paragraphs:-->
	<p>This is the first paragraph</p>
	<p>This is the second paragraph</p>

<!--Now let's begin using the different variety of heading tags:-->
	<h1>This is the 'h1' heading</h1> <!--The CEO-->
	<h2>This is the 'h2' heading</h2> <!--Vice Prez-->
	<h3>This is the 'h3' heading</h3> <!--Director-->
	<h4>This is the 'h4' heading</h4> <!--Middle Management-->
	<h5>This is the 'h5' heading</h5> <!--Lowly Assistant-->
	<h6>This is the 'h6' heading</h6> <!--Intern-->

<!--What if we want to add clickable links to our website? We use the 'a' element to create links:-->
<a href = "https://www.google.com/">Search</a>
<!--The 'a' element has a 'href' attribute which is the website you are linking to which can be any website of your choosing! The word "Search" will be what the user can click on in the webpage-->

<!--What if we want to add images to our website? We use the 'img' element to add images:-->
<img src = "logo.png">
<!--There is an attribute 'src' which addresses the SOURCE of the image-->

<!--What if we wanted to present content in lists? We use the 'ul' element for bulleted lists and 'li' for each individual item within the list:-->
<ul>
	<li>Home</li>
	<li>About</li>
</ul>

<!--Now we need to be able to display everything we are putting up in our webpage! So we use the 'body' element to insert what the user will see:-->
<body>
	<h1>Web Development</h1>
	<p>We're learning HTML</p>
	<img src = "logo.png">
	<a href = "https://www.google.com">Search</a>
</body>
